// This challenge, youâ€™ll write a function, called best, that returns the maximum profit possible for buying-and-selling a stock.

// The best function will be given an array of stock prices in the order they happened throughout the day.

// It should return the maximum possible profit on the stock for that day.

// For example, with the following prices, our best option would have been to buy the stock at $10 and sell it at $22. So the profit would be $12:

// best([15, 10, 20, 22, 1, 9])
// 12

// If no profit is possible, return $0:

// best([5, 4 , 3, 2, 1])
// 0

////////// CODE HERE //////////

let array = [2, 3, 10, 6, 4, 8, 1];
